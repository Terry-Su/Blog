<0>Hi, glad to meet you, welcome to visit my blog. I'm Terry Su, a 4 years Front-End engineer from China, who loves English very much.</0>

<1>I've learned English seriously these years and kept practicing thinking in English, and it turns out that now I can express my ideas in English naturally without interpreting them from Chinese, though it may be non-native.</1>
